# comick-rss
Introducing **Comick-RSS**,
an RSS feed that provides updates for comick.app. Usage is simple, just grab the raw link to a feed and put it into the reader. 
We currently offer SFW feeds for various languages including English, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, and Turkish.

Note that the feed auto-updates every hour, and we plan to add more languages and websites in the future. 

Below are example links to each language's SFW feed:
